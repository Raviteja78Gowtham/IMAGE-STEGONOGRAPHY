Image Steganography

Description :

This project demonstrates image steganography, a technique for hiding text within an image using Python and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module.

Install dependencies (PIL is required) :

pip install Pillow

Encoding (Hiding Text in Image) :

To hide text in an image, use the encode.py script. Replace image.jpg with your input image, "Secret message" with the text you want to hide, and encoded_image.png with the output image file name.

Decoding (Extracting Text from Image) :

To extract hidden text from an encoded image, use the decode.py script. Replace encoded_image.png with the path to your encoded image

This provides clear instructions on how to install, use, and contribute to the image steganography project.
